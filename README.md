# Weather app

Using the weather api to showcase the temperature now and for the next five days in London.

- Project assignment through Technigo to follow a design and make the api call to display relevant weather information.
- Page is setup to be responsive and display nicely both on desktop and mobile devices.
- Pending if it's past sunset, or tbe current weather, the background on the hero area will change color. Each icon for the weather will also change pending the weather as well as if it is past sunset.
- If I had more time I'd include a searchbar or check the user location to display the weahter for where they are. That'd make use for the hamburger menu to toggle between cities or going back which was ignored in this view. I also did not include the circular button as I didnt want to add an elemnet not clickable.
- Id also remove the api key and move to a hidden gitignore file.
